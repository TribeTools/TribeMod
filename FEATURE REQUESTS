One old thing that I would love to see the return of is the coloring of names in the TAB button menu. 

I want a dedicated spawn cake button that will spawn cakes and drop them so I can be a cake dispenser. 

I want a quick way to jail/kick/mute, is that possible to add in franticmod? 

All I ever saw on it was the vanished text and the WG notifications. It would be awesome if NCP alerts did the same thing. I saw screenshots of the colored text in tab which looked nice. Also, being able to ban guests in-game would be nice. 

Could you add a toggle for the /vanish check? I occasionally play on a different server where I don't have permission to do that and I get spammed.
